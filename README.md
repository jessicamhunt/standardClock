# Adventure Time Clock

A simple Adeventure Time themed clock built with CSS. It takes in the current time from JavaScript and updates the minute, hour, and second hands accordingly.

## Description

This is a basic clock application that can be used to tell time. It is built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

### Dependencies

So, far this app works in Chrome. More programming would be needed to ensure cross browser compatibility. Other than that, there are no other dependancies needed to use the clock.

### Installing
